# Pistorm Relocated

This folder contains the gerbers of the pistorm version made for the RetroWIKI forum (without the logo included). This version is different from the original, it has been redesigned using Claude's PDF schematics to relocate the RPI to the back to avoid the keyboard of the a 500 hit and avoid closing the top case. Also allow to use any kind of RPI from 3A to 3B or RPI 4.

Also includes the last changes made by Claude for Max V cpld compatibility.

# Female connector for pi

You need a female 2x20 2.54" connector with long pins because you need to lift the female pin from the pcb at least 5mm in order to avoid USB connectors from PI3B and the rest to hit the Denise chip.

# Bom & Pick and place files

There are two files on the ZIP, one is the bom files based on the lcsc references and the other is a pick and place file for the pcb manufacturer. The format of these excels are JLCPCB friendly.

# Gerbers

This project is made in 4 layers so take good care about it when you select on your pcb manufacturer web page.

# License

You must respect and follow the guidelines of the original PISTORM project. Which declares:

Even selling blank PCBs at eBay or so without my approval might makes me pretty mad and probably leads to the forthcomming related projects to be closed source. You have been warned :)

# Extra notes
If you remove the text on the PCB or you sell blank board on you ebay account listen to this:

"I will look for you, I will find you, and I will k... you."
